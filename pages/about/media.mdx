[Students faking certificate](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/law-graduate-fined-s10000-doctoring-nus-degree-certificate-transcript-improve-job) could be a thing of the past soon. Shortly after joining GovTech, I worked on [OpenCerts](https://opencerts.io/). OpenCerts is a platform to issue and validate digital education credentials on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of the project is to minimize overheads in verifying issued certificates for schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in Singapore. At the same time, it also help prevent fake certificates as each certificate can be verified on the blockchain. The project is open sourced and could be found on [Github](https://github.com/openCerts/).

Was looking for more interesting data set for learning data mining instead of the boring Iris Dataset. Decided to scrape for game data in the Pokemon Go game, run them through RapidMiner with different models and publish my findings. The article was well received by both the data science community and gamers alike.

Was later invited to Temasek International to conduct an introductory workshop on data mining.

I took part in the submission for the ‘[15 Stations](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26862169/SIFA-2015-15-Stations-the-OPEN)‘ piece through my digital art module ‘[DA9006 Augmenting Singapore – We are the Metaverse](http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/Undergraduate/UndergraduateProgrammes/Documents/InterdisciplinaryCourses%20-%20DA9006%20(F).pdf)‘ by [Tamiko Thiel](http://www.tamikothiel.com/).

Facing the other direction, towards the tracks, we see a futuristic train stations signifying the ambitious future ahead.

[SgHazeRescue](https://www.facebook.com/SgHazeRescue/) was a ground-up initiative to [help the vulnerable through one of the toughest haze period in 2013](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/haze-update-singaporeans-join-hands-to-help-people-weather-haze). Through crowdsourced effort we were able to render help to these people through issuing of sponsored haze mask and educating the people about how to protect themselves. These effort were later supported by [government](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/imindef/resourcelibrary/cyberpioneer/topics/articles/news/2013/jun/22jun13_news2.html) and grassroot initiatives.

My contribution was through the coordination of mask distribution by volunteers using a web application for visualising the distribution and team movements.
