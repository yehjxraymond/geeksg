About
===

Welcome to my page! I'm Raymond Yeh, a geek obsesed with distributed ledger technology (blockchain), data science and computer security.

## Work

In my professional life, I'm a software developer with GovTech Singapore working on building awesome citizen-centric products for fellow Singaporean.

I am currently working on [OpenCerts](https://opencerts.io/), a digital certificate framework to issue and verify education credentials on the blockchain. I'm subscribed to the belief that end-users should have control over their data, and that's what OpenCerts is built upon. I enjoy evangelising the inversion of control of data and embedding trust in the new web, to form [web 3.0](https://link.medium.com/VIk6x2kzNV)

If you are interested in what I do at GovTech, talk to me, my team is currently hiring!

## Play

I enjoy playing boardgames and console games like Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart and Mario Party. Be sure to ask me out for your game night - or I can host!

My hidden talent is show and tell, as pointed out by my colleagues. Ask me to share:

- a magic trick or two
- mobile app hacking/spoofing
- high frequency & arbitrage trading

I believe in improving social mobility through education and will be happy to collaborate on meaningful projects.
