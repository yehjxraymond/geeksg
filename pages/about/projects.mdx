## High Speed Intra-exchange Arbitrage Bot

<div className="text-center m-4">
  <img

    className="w-50"
  />
</div>

Having worked on a inter-exchange arbitrage bot, I began to wonder if cryptocurrency exchanges checks for intra-exchange arbitrage opportunities and found one that didn't. The method involves a series of trade that exchanges one product to another and eventually back to itself, with resulting yield greater than the original amount. For example, BTC -> ETH -> XRP -> BTC, where the final amount of BTC is greater than the original amount (used to trade for ETH). Using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, I'm able to spot these opportunities and built a bot around the theory. This bot has traded well over 10 million SGD in trading volume, in a single month, and has netted me an iPhone X for being the top trader (in volume) in December 2017.

The MailPhaser was born as a prank, but packs a serious punch.

As many of these mailing list are low quality and tends to be resold, the victim's email may be included in more list than what they were signed up for. Essentially, the application does an reflection attack on email (and mail server), causing a DOS on said email address and mail server. Existing mail filters are incapable of stopping the deluge of emails. The application does do by harvesting massive number of mailing list forms.

## SG Haze Rescue

SG Haze Rescue is a community of Singaporeans sharing resources to help individuals and families to overcome this hazy period. The community was formed in response to the worst episode of haze in 2013.

As there were multiple groups of people giving out masks at that point in time, the team needed a site to track the volunteers on the ground to prevent duplicated visits and ensure a wider distribution of masks. As a result, I’ve joined the team to build the site in the shortest period of time. The project soon garnered major media attention in a short span of time due to it’s scale and impact. Shortly after, the Singapore Ministry of Defence took over in the distribution of free mask to the community centres.
