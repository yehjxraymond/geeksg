Right after the release of the 2nd Generation Pokemon in Pokemon Go, I’ve got my scanners working and collecting Pokemon spawn data. Over the last 24 hours (minus a few hours of downtime), I’ve collected 182,898 individual spawn data for Gen II Pokemon.

As I begin working on the data, here is a quick glimpse of how rare different Pokemon are.   

One of the most common questions that people seemed to ask on various platforms on the first day of the Gen 2 Pokemon release was that “Is this rare?”.

Looking at the records, here are the top 10 rarest Pokemon observed in Singapore. The numbers in bracket are the number of observations.

1. Ampharos (1)
2. Unown (1)
3. Tyranitar (2)
4. Blissey (5)
5. Typhlosion (16)
6. Pupitar (16)
7. Flaaffy (21)
8. Hitmontop (27)
9. Miltank (36)
10. Piloswine (42)

The other contenders right after the top 10 include:

- Togetic
- Forretress
- Jumpluff
- Meganium
- Feraligatr
- Houndoom

If you have got one of those in the list, congratulation! You may not show off that screenshot you have to your friends. Be sure to send them this link for them to verify its authenticity.

If you don’t it’s alright, below is the graph of the number of Pokemon according to their index. The lower the dot, the rarer is the Pokemon.
