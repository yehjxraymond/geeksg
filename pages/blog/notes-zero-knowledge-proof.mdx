Zokrates vs Circom

Learning curve
    zokrates is easier for functional programmer, circom is more like verilog programming

Efficiency
    circom is painfully slow with sha256, zokrates seemed to be faster at setup
    circom allows for you to use few bits 

Tutorial & material
    zokrates sucks. circom sucks even more.


Smart contract generation/interaction
    why is zokrate emitting events!?
    circom's smart contract call is `view` no need to spend gas
    circom generates the call data

Non blockchain support
    circom has js lib

Testing
    circom has test

Verdict
    Circom

    "I know a number bigger than that number"
    "I know a number that hashes to that number"
    "I know a number that hashes to that number and that number is bigger than that number"
