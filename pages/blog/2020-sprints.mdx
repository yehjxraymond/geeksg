2020 in Sprints
===

## Week 11 (11th Mar - 18th Mar) - 

## Week 10 (4th Mar - 11th Mar) - Have fun in Greece

## Week 9 (26th Feb - 4th Mar) - Have fun in Turkey

## Week 8 (19th Feb - 26th Feb) - SEO & Monetisation

### Sprint Goal

- SEO
- Monetisation

### Retrospective

Trying out the new SEO broke the entire ranking of the entire site. My initial mistake was to use a very generic title for all the pages. Turns out, that deprioritised the ranking for the individual question page because the question description is no longer in the title. 

The later part of the week was spent on fixing and monitoring the SEO performance. Judging from the trend, the title has been fixed for now and pages are ranking once again on Google. 

Now that the site is in this state, it will be best to monitor for SEO performance over the next two weeks or so when I'm out of Singapore. Shall take a good long break for now.

## Week 7 (12th Feb - 19th Feb) - SEO & Monetisation

Last week was pretty much populating the entire site with examination questions. Since then there are trickles of users coming in from organic search, but those seemed to be queries copied directly from digital sources already. This week will be focused on SEO to ensure that the site is search engine friendly and to explore monetisation methods such as linking up with Udemy, Amazon and Clickbank products.

### Sprint Goal

- SEO Question Page
- SEO Exam Index Page
- SEO Home Page
- SEO Vendor's Exam Page
- SEO Vendors Page
- Sign up for Amazon affiliate, Udemy & Clickbank
- Module for ads

### Done

- SEO Question Page
- SEO Exam Index Page
- SEO Vendor's Exam Page
- SEO Vendors Page

## Week 6 (5th Feb - 12th Feb) - Site content

The examination engine and front page design has been tied up. 

## Week 5 (29th Jan - 5th Feb) - Concrete site structure

The bulk of last week was spent on house visiting during CNY and also building the e-Ration app. I didn't have much screen time to build my certification training platform. The remaining of this sprint (it's 2/2 today) shall focus on that. 

- Index of Exams

## Week 4 (22th Jan - 29th Jan) - Chinese New Year & New Site

- First draft site with questions from 5 certifications online

### Done

- Caught up with project Rationally and managed to build and deliver the entire mobile app on Expo
- Registered and configured domain name
- Generated individual question page

### Retrospective

Turns out the Chinese New Year week was crazy.

The Wuhan virus really shook Singapore. Having seen the situation of outage of supplies across the island I'm more convinced that to protect the vulnerables, we need to practice rationing. That was my calling when Steven called me at 10:30pm to ask me to build an app to do that. Over the next few days when the app was build I learn about how bad the supplies hording situation is becoming and the uglier side of Singaporeans. I do hope that the situation tide over soon enough before we get to see the ugly side of Singaporeans. I do not have faith it will be pretty.

That said, most of the work on Rationally is done, and I'll put my spare time back at my side project.

## Week 3 (15th Jan - 22th Jan) - Information gathering for internet marketing

Was inspired by Norvin to get started again to look at internet marketing. Has been long since I've read up on it and will require intensive deep dive into the various different aspects of it. Will likely have to reach out to people who are doing it and learn from them. 

- Reach out to someone who has done affliate marketing before to learn from them
- Read up deep on affiliate marketing
- Information gathering for products, keywords and competition

### Done

- Started on the course for affiliate marketing and completed most sections
- Done keyword research for professional certificates catergory, found some possible niche in military (ASVAB), nurses (https://nurse.org/articles/nursing-certifications-credentials-list/), etc
- Decided on having free? online certification quiz site
- Wrote api to process vce files to be used
- Uploaded 5 question banks to be used by the site

---

## Week 2 (8th Jan - 15th Jan) - Deep dive into mobile security in preparation of Android hacking course

- Read up on iOS hacking
- Practice hacking by exploring the internals of a few apps on iOS

### Done

- Hacked an iOS mobile game by changing the game file in Document directory
- Hacked an SG government app by circumventing encryption mechanism
- Filed a vulnerability report (yay) to the appropriate department on the findings and suggestions

### Retrospective

Pleasant surpries at the practicals. It was super empowering to cheat on the mobile game, showing how easy it is to manipulate client side information. Met several hurdle when trying to hack other games due to encrypted save files. Attempts at other apps were also unsuccessful due to inexperience in reverse engineering other frameworks such as .NET. Also, I did not manage to find an application that is written in ObjC/Swift that uses the default crypto libraries to practice on hooking and swizzling methods. 

Best part of the week was when I've managed to hack into a mobile app by one of the SG governemnt agency and successfully executed a POC attack. With that, I've also picked up on how to write vulnerability reports!
