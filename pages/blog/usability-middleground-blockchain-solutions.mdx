  summary: "Right after the release of the 2nd Generation Pokemon in Pokemon Go, I’ve got my scanners working and collecting Pokemon spawn data. Over the last 24 hours (minus a few hours of downtime), I’ve collected 182,898 individual spawn data for Gen II Pokemon. As I begin working on the data, here is a quick glimpse of how rare different Pokemon are."

A Usability Middleground for Blockchain Solution - Authoritative Relays
===

Interoperablity is a problem which keeps presenting itself when designing a blockchain solution. In preserving the high degree of decentralisation, often more blockchains are created to solve the problem, often leading to proliferation. What if we can trade off decentralisation for usability? 

## Usability

> Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. A design is not usable or unusable per se; its features, together with the context of the user (what the user wants to do with it and the user’s environment), determine its level of usability.

A product's usability cannot be measured without the context of the user. Naturally, a blockchain product will have different degree of usability to:
- a human user
- another program using the same standards & interface
- another program not using the same standards & interface

## A case against standardisation

We can make sure that there are no other program

Interoperable Interface

Interoperable Data

There are tons of technical decision to make in rolling out a simple blockchain product. Decentralised vs centralised. Private blockchain vs public blockchain. Ethereum vs hyperledger. Even for consensus algorithms, there are [tons of it](https://hackernoon.com/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-consensus-algorithms-d81aae3eb0e3). One concern which keeps coming up is how to make the solution interoperable? 

## Surely we can have a global standards right?

You cannot blame a developer if he suffers from analysis paralysis.
