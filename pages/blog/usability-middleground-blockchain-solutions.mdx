  summary: "Right after the release of the 2nd Generation Pokemon in Pokemon Go, I’ve got my scanners working and collecting Pokemon spawn data. Over the last 24 hours (minus a few hours of downtime), I’ve collected 182,898 individual spawn data for Gen II Pokemon. As I begin working on the data, here is a quick glimpse of how rare different Pokemon are."

A Usability Middleground for Blockchain Solutions - Authoritative Relays
===

Interoperablity is a problem which keeps presenting itself when designing a blockchain solution. To solve the problem of interoperable blockchain, often more blockchains are created, leading to standards and products proliferation. Of which, hardly any are usable for the regular user on the street. 

## Usability

> Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. A design is not usable or unusable per se; its features, together with the context of the user (what the user wants to do with it and the user’s environment), determine its level of usability.

A product's usability cannot be measured without the context of the user. In the case of blockchain solutions, the consumer could be other machines or programs as well! As a result, a blockchain product will have different degree of usability to:

- a human user
- another program using the same standards & interface
- another program not using the same standards & interface

Interestingly enough, when I look at existing products, they are hardly designed for human users or other machines that do not use the same standards & interface. 

But first, what's usability?

### Usability for Human Users

Designing a product for humans is tricky. Existing products tend to assume that their users have a wallet, have the ability to manage their private keys, have basic knowledge of how cryptography works, etc. Through my experience with real users, even a file with unfamiliar file extension could drive users crazy. Try getting regular users to manage a excessively long and crpytic string of characters - something we call private keys? 

How do we then introduce layers of abstraction to shield the user from the complexity of blockchain? Just like how the browser helps a grandma navigate the internet without knowing how TCP/IP, routing, or even HTML work. 

### Usability for Systems Not Using the Same Standards or Interface

Surely one can argue that we can surely solve the problem through standardisation - by getting everyone to use the same product/interface/protocol/data schema! Right?

No.

We need to have the humility to admit that there is always an edge case that your product team has not considered, and it will be near impossible to design an all encompasing product. There will be another similar product that does better than yours in a slightly different context or environment that you've designed your product in. There is bound to be competitive product. 

How then do you design your solution to delight your users who interacts with users of competing products?

What if we can trade off decentralisation for usability?
