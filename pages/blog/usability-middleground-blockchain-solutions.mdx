  summary: "Right after the release of the 2nd Generation Pokemon in Pokemon Go, I’ve got my scanners working and collecting Pokemon spawn data. Over the last 24 hours (minus a few hours of downtime), I’ve collected 182,898 individual spawn data for Gen II Pokemon. As I begin working on the data, here is a quick glimpse of how rare different Pokemon are."

A Usability Middleground for Blockchain Solutions - Authoritative Fallback Relays
===

Interoperablity is a problem which keeps presenting itself when designing a blockchain solution. To solve the problem of interoperable blockchain, often more blockchains are created, leading to standards and products proliferation. Of which, hardly any are usable for the regular user on the street. 

## Usability

> Usability is part of the broader term “user experience” and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website. A design is not usable or unusable per se; its features, together with the context of the user (what the user wants to do with it and the user’s environment), determine its level of usability.

A product's usability cannot be measured without the context of the user. In the case of blockchain solutions, the consumer could be other machines or programs as well! As a result, a blockchain product will have different degree of usability to:

- a human user
- another program using the same standards & interface
- another program not using the same standards & interface

Interestingly enough, when I look at existing products, they are hardly designed for human users or other machines that do not use the same standards & interface. 

But first, what's usability?

### Usability for Human Users

Designing a product for humans is tricky. Existing products tend to assume that their users have a wallet, have the ability to manage their private keys, have basic knowledge of how cryptography works, etc. Through my experience with real users, even a file with unfamiliar file extension could drive users crazy. Try getting regular users to manage a excessively long and crpytic string of characters - something we call private keys? 

How do we then introduce layers of abstraction to shield the user from the complexity of blockchain? Just like how the browser helps a grandma navigate the internet without knowing how TCP/IP, routing, or even HTML work. 

### Usability for Systems Not Using the Same Standards or Interface

Surely one can argue that we can surely solve the problem through standardisation - by getting everyone to use the same product/interface/protocol/data schema! Right?

No.

We need to have the humility to admit that there is always an edge case that your product team has not considered, and it will be near impossible to design an all encompasing product. There will be another similar product that does better than yours in a slightly different context or environment that you've designed your product in. There is bound to be competitive product. 

How then do you design your solution to delight your users who interacts with users of competing products? 

## Mimicking Existing "Solutions"

Mimicking existing interface, data schema or artifacts is one way we can introduce familiarity to our user. When designing a solution, we need to take a approach where users using your product will be worse off, not even in scenarios where they have to interact with users of other products. In this case, it will be in your interest, as a product owner, to have a fallback mechanism to more familiar processes or artifacts. 

Falling back to existing non-blockchain solution does not mean creating another suite of 'general relay blockchain to solve all integration problem'. Instead, these relays need to be hyperspecific and tightly coupled with the use case and must ingest or output real on-the-ground artifacts. In addition, the entity running the relay must be identifiable and be held legally accountable to their duties.

### Successful Model - Crypto Exchanges

Think of how a centralised, fiat-crypto exchange work. There is an agreement that if I withdraw `x` SGD (proceed from selling my BTC) from the exchange, I will receive `x - y` SGD in my bank account - where `y` is the processing fee.

#### Authoritative

This model will fail if the relay is not `authoritative`. 

If the exchange is ran by some teenagers, not registered as a company (local or oversea), or not held legally accountable to deposited funds, no users will trust the product/service.

#### Fallback

This model will fail if the relay does not `fallback` to artifacts that is currently used in the real world.

If the exchange was to present me SGD-Token instead of SGD I can withdraw from my bank, it will not work. It does not matter if there is a legal framework here that legally bind you to swap the token for real cash elsewhere.

#### Relay

This model will fail if the `relay` is not hyperspecific. 

If the exchange do not have a BTC/SGD pair, it will not work. If the exchange does not support sending 100k to a specifc bank in Singapore, it will not work. If the exchange is not connected to the BTC network or the bank I'm a customer of (directly or indirectly), it will not work. 

Essentially, the fiat-crypto exchange is a `Authoritative Fallback Relay` which worked! Yep I coined that term up, bear with me. 

## Applying Authoritative Fallback Relay

Let's see how we can use this relay for some of the products out there!

### DID - Case of a driving license

Imagine for a moment that in a very advanced nation where the traffic department is issuing and verifying driving licenses as verifable claims to their citizens. All is well within that nation, no one has to bring around additional driving license card in their wallet. In fact, the traffic department no longer print and issue physical cards.

The problem arise when citizens of this country would like to drive in another nation where the traffic police, and the bouncer at the bar, expects physical driving licenses. They know nothing about blockchain, decentralised IDs or verifiable claims.

### The case of OpenCerts

What if we can trade off decentralisation for usability? 




In exchange for carrying out its duty as a authoritative fallback relay, the exchange is rewarded the processing fee (`y + BTC to SGD margins`) for the withdrawal of my cryptocurrency.
