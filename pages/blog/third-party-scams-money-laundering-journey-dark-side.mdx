Third-party Scams & Money Laundering - A Journey to the Dark Side
===

S$99 million was lost to scams in 2017. In the first half of 2018, scams on Carousell rose by 136%. How does this money get moved around, out of Singapore, into the hands of the famous Nigerian prince? I was offered a glimpse into the world of money laundering in back in 2017 as a cryptocurrency trader. I'll take you through a journey of how several innocent and honest folks can find their way to be part of the money laundering scheme. Sit tight.

To show you how easily one might fall victim to being part of this scheme, the story will be broken down into different facet, as experienced by the different key characters. 

## The Buyer (feat Mr Gullible)

Mr Gullible was searching through Carousell, online P2P e-commerce in Singapore, for a pair of tickets to a sold-out concert next week. It didn't take him long before he chanced upon a seller for the ticket. 

Mr Gullible found the price to be very steep and is pissed at ticket resellers for driving the price sky-high. He started haggling with the seller, citing all kinds of reasons you can find on [carouhell](http://carouhell.tumblr.com/). Sure enough, the seller relents and agree to meet his offer in the middle, if he could confirm his purchase and transfer the money to him instantly. 

> "Someone else is offering me the same price and is ready to pay. Because you came first, I'll let you have it if you can confirm and make the payment now. Do you want it or not?" - Seller 

For $200 Mr Gullible gets his concert tickets priority-mailed to him. Except, the priority mail never came. 

Mr Gullible, knowing he was scammed, filed a police report detailing his conversation history with the seller and the seller bank account number.

## The Bitcoin Seller (feat Mr Crypto)

Mr Crypto is one of the few folks lurking on [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/), a P2P bitcoin trading platform. He buys bitcoin from people who want to cash out their coins, and he sells it to people who wanted to buy. For each trade, he gets 1-5% margin and he has been trading for a while now. 

Mr Crypto takes extra precaution to know who is he trading with for [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) & [AML](http://www.mas.gov.sg/Regulations-and-Financial-Stability/Anti-Money-Laundering-Countering-The-Financing-Of-Terrorism-And-Targeted-Financial-Sanctions/Anti-Money-Laundering-and-Countering-the-Financing-of-Terrorism.aspx) reasons. He requests for a copy of the ID of who he trades with and ensure that buyers pay using their own bank accounts. 

One fine afternoon, he receives a trade request from *ImNotAScammer* for $3400 of bitcoins. As usual, he requested for necessary documents prior to the trade and verified that he is trading with *Mr Accountant* with his ID.

Mr Crypto requested for *ImNotAScammer* to send $3400 to his bank account first while his bitcoins on localbitcoins are held in escrow. Within minutes, he verified that he has received $3400 in his bank account from an account belonging to *Mr Accountant*. Seeing that he has received the payments, he promptly release the bitcoins to *ImNotAScammer* on localbitcoins. 

Mr Crypto has netted himself $170 on this trade.

Weeks later, Mr Crypto was called for an investigation, at [CID - Technology Crime Investigation Branch](https://www.police.gov.sg/about-us/organisational-structure/specialist-staff-departments/criminal-investigation-department#content) related to the above trade.

## The Job Seeker (feat Mr Accountant)

Mr Accountant has recently found himself in heavy financial crisis after he was retrenched from his previous role as an administrative executive. With a family to feed and limited savings, he is under tremendous pressure to reinstate his income. 

While scouring through several job boards, he found himself a part-time role in a commerce company as a finance executive. As the owner of the company explained, the company has yet to set up their bank account and they will have to make do with using his account for receiving regular payments. He will need to set up a new bank account specifically for this purpose. He has to send the owner a copy of his ID and regular update on the account balance. From time to time, he is also required to make payment to several suppliers for their goods. 

In the first month, he received over $8000 of payments for goods and has paid *Supplier A* $2300, *Supplier B* $3400 and *Supplier C* $1650.   

For what he is doing, he gets pay himself $800 monthly, decent pay for an online part time job. 

In the second month of his job, he was called down to the CID cantonment complex for investigation, on multiple Carousell and e-commerce scams. 

## The Puzzle

Before I unveil the last facet of the story, that of the scammer, I would invite you to try to guess what actually happened. How did Mr Crypto and Mr Accountant get themselves involved in scamming Mr Gullible and laundering the money out to Nigeria?
